Hello, I'm Luke Albracht, a dedicated data analytics enthusiast and supply chain strategist. My journey into the realm of data analytics commenced upon graduating from Baylor University with a degree in Supply Chain Management. Encountering real-world data challenges in my professional endeavors, I proactively enhanced my academic foundation by mastering data tools such as R and Alteryx. With over five years of hands-on experience in data extraction, analysis, and supply chain strategy, I deeply understand the pivotal role of data in driving team success. I've created this site to serve as a collection of projects to build on as I learn and develop in the area of data analytics.

Outside of work, I enjoy riding my bike, playing video games, and spending time with my lovely wife, Jesse.
